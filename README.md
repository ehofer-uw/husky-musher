# husky-musher

This is a fork of the original Husky Musher redirecting service for the
UW Husky Coronavirus Testing study. This fork only adapts the survey
redirect modules, but also productionizes the application for
deployment.


## Developer requirements

- Follow the [first-time use instructions](#first-time-use)

## Running from docker

### Run an existing build

As long as you have a docker client, you can run an existing build.

1. [View the package in Github](https://github.com/UWIT-IAM/husky-musher/blob/main/husky_musher/settings.py#L8)
2. Find the tag you are interested in running (usually the newest tag is your best
   option) and copy it to your clipboard
3. In your terminal, run `docker pull ghcr.io/uwit-iam/husky-musher:<tag>`
4. Then, run `docker run -it -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/uwit-iam/husky-musher:<tag>`
    - Replace `<tag>` with the tag you copied to your clipboard.
    - Add `--env-file local.env` before the `ghcr` argument if you followed the
      [environment variables](#environment-variables)
      instructions and have all the necessary variables handy.

### Run from local source

#### If you have `bash` installed:

Recommended; this will typically build faster because
it is dependency-aware and uses some common optimization practices
shared between UW-IT IAM projects.

```
./scripts/build-images.sh --run
```

This will automatically look for a `local.env` file if you don't provide an
`--env-file` argument; if `local.env` is not found, the application will boot
but may not actually do much.

### Using just docker:

```
docker build . -t husky-musher:local
docker run  \
   # Omit the --env-file argument if you have not generated an env-file to use
   --env-file local.dotenv \
   # Omit the `--mount` argument if you do not want to sync
   # the running container with your local changes
   --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/husky_musher,target=/musher/husky_musher"
   -p 8000:8000 \
   -it husky-musher:local
```

## Running without docker

If you are actively developing, you may be interested in running this
directly from source without docker, for debugging purposes.

No problem!

**If this is your first time running locally**, follow [first-time use](#first-time-use).

Then:

```
set -a               # Export all vars sourced in the next line
source local.env     
set +a               # Stop var exporting to avoid side effects in any future commands
poetry run flask run
```

### First-time use


#### Recommended setup:


If you are running a unix- or linux-like termina,
and have both `poetry` and `pyenv`, you can paste the
following into your terminal to configure your environment:

```bash
pyenv install 3.8.6
poetry env use ~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.6/bin/python
poetry install
```

You should also think about creating an env file to export
environment variables; see [environment variables](#environment-variables).

Otherwise . . .

#### Manual setup:

First, [get poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Poetry makes it easy
to manage application versions and dependency versions consistently and safely.

Set up your local environment to use python version 3.7+. If you don't
know how to manage python versions,
see [managing python versions](#managing-python-versions).

```
poetry env use /path/to/python
poetry install
```

You should also think about creating an env file to export
environment variables; see [environment variables](#environment-variables).


#### Managing python versions

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is great for this, as long as you
are not using Windows. If you are using Windows, please see the notes in
the pyenv installation docs.

```
pyenv install 3.8.6
# Test the install:
~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.6/bin/python --version
```

## Environment Variables

Some REDCap information is necessary to fully test this application. You can still
run the app without these variables, but it won't actually do anything.

If you copy the following into a file (editing any variables necessary), you can
save it to `local.env` which is ignored by git and consumed by default, if it exists.

```

## Pushing to the registry

To push to the Github docker registry, you must
have a Personal Access Token with the correct scopes, and
permissions to push.

See [Github's official documentation on working with packages.](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry)


```
docker push ghcr.io/uwit-iam/husky-musher:<tag>
```
